# lol-champselect-ui
UI to display the league of legends champion selection in esports tournaments.

## Rough Architecture:
TODO (Graphic)

## Features
- Connects to the League Client and fetches information about the current champ select in real time
- Automatically fetches champion loading images, splash arts and square icons from datadragon, which means that if a new champion
is released it will automatically fetch the correct resources.
- Ready to use design templates:
  - Europe (similar to the pick&ban UI used in the LEC)
- Easy feature toggle (when using design templates) for:
  - Show / hide scores (usable if it's not best of 1)
  - Show / hide coaches
  - Show / hide summoner spells (usable in live matches on the live server where the enemy team is not supposed to see the summoner 
  spells of the opposite team.
- Easy configuration:
  - Set team names
  - Set coach names
  - Set score
  - Set colors (default blue/red, but they can differ!)
- Allows to completely create a custom design based on web technologies (HTML, CSS & JS), including custom animations and
transitions

## Installation (Development purposes)
1. Download and install Node.JS for Windows (or any other operating system): https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-x64.msi
2. Download or clone this Git-Repository to your local machine.
3. Inside the downloaded folder, open up a command prompt (Windows: Shift + Rightclick -> Open Powershell / Commandline Window here)
4. Install all required dependencies for the backend using the command `npm install`
5. Start the backend using the command `npm start`
6. The backend should now launch on localhost:8999
7. Open up the folder "layouts/layout-volu-europe", keep the backend open & running!
8. Also open the terminal here (like in step 3)
9. Also issue `npm install` (like in step 4)
10. Also start the frontend using `npm start` (like in step 5)
