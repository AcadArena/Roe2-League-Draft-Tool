# lol-champselect-ui
UI to display the league of legends champion selection in esports tournaments.

## Rough Architecture:
TODO (Graphic)

## Features
- Connects to the League Client and fetches information about the current champ select in real time
- Automatically fetches champion loading images, splash arts and square icons from datadragon, which means that if a new champion
is realised it will automatically fetch the correct resources.
- Ready to use design templates:
  - Europe (similar to the pick&ban UI used in the LEC)
- Easy feature toggle (when using design templates) for:
  - Show / hide scores (usable if it's not best of 1)
  - Show / hide coaches
  - Show / hide summoner spells (usable in live matches on the live server where the enemy team is not supposed to see the summoner 
  spells of the opposite team.
- Easy configuration:
  - Set team names
  - Set coach names
  - Set score
  - Set colors (default blue/red, but they can differ!)
- Allows to completely create a custom design based on web technologies (HTML, CSS & JS), including custom animations and
transitions
